## Customize card content

In this prototype, card data is retrieved from <strong>./cardData.json</strong>

Each key/value pair in the object of cards represents a card ID and its corresponding data.

The starting card should always have ID `start`.

The prperties of each card's data are as follows:

* `text` -- the text of the card
* `leftText` -- text of the left button when the card is displyed
* `leftCardID` -- ID of the next card the user is shown when the left button is clicked
* `rightText` -- text of the right button when the card is displyed
* `rightCardID` -- ID of the next card the user is shown when the right button is clicked
